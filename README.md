### RAM Legacy Stock Boundary Database

#### Description

The RAM Legacy Stock Boundary Database provides the spatial boundaries for the 685 non-salmon stocks in the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database (v.4.41; Ricard et al. 2012).

Each version of the Stock Boundary Database offers the following files:

1. Shapefiles
2. Rasters
3. PNGs

The shapefiles and rasters are all in the following coordinate system:

* WGS 1984 Mollweide in meters
* CRS("+proj=moll +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")


#### Reporting errors

Please report incorrectly delineated stocks or issues using the data by [creating an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) in this GitHub repository.


#### Brief methods description

Boundaries were delineated by: 

1. Merging the statistical/management areas used to define the assessment area;
2. Digitizing the assessment area directly from the stock assessment; or
3. Clipping the managing country’s exclusive economic zone or the managing agency’s area of competence to the geographical reference points provided in the stock assessment. 

In the USA and Australia, information on the geographic distribution of each species was used to further constrain stock boundaries.
